College, the level of similarity for the P.G. Project Reports are fixed to the maximum of 50 % for 
the chapters such as Results and Discussion, Summary, Conclusion and Recommendati ons. All 
the P.G. students should submit their Project Reports to the College Librarian for a similarity 
check. The College librarian, after examining the Project Reports using UGC recommended - 
licensed Plagiarism software available in the College Library , will issue a Certificate indicating 
the level of plagiarism of the scanned copy and stating that the percentage of similarity is less 
than the level recommended by the Academic Integrity Committee of the College. This 
Certificate is to be appended on the  Project Reports before being submitted to the Controller of 
Examinations (P.G. Programmes). Project Reports with similarity level above the recommended 
level have to be revised and resubmitted.

RULES GOVERNING THE EVALUATION OF PROJECT REPORT AND viva voce   
1. Selection of Topic: Each student shall select a topic for his / her project in consultation with 
his / her Guide and the Head of the Department.   
 
2. The project report should contain a minimum of 25 pages in A4 format excluding bibliography 
and appendices.   
 
3. Each student should submit two copies of his / her project report for evaluation.   
 
4. Plagiarism Checking: Considering the diversity of P.G. Programmes being offered in the 
College, the level of similarity for the P.G. Project Reports are fixed to the maximum of 50 % for 
the chapters such as Results and D iscussion, Summary, Conclusion and Recommendations. All 
the P.G. students should submit their Project Reports to the College Librarian for a similarity 
check. The College librarian, after examining the Project Reports using UGC recommended - 
licensed Plagi arism software available in the College Library, will issue a Certificate indicating 
the level of plagiarism of the scanned copy and stating that the percentage of similarity is less 
than the level recommended by the Academic Integrity Committee of the Col lege. This 
Certificate is to be appended on the Project Reports before being submitted to the Controller of 
Examinations (P.G. Programmes). Project Reports with similarity level above the recommended 
level have to be revised and resubmitted.   
 
5. Last date  for the submission of Project Report: The project report should be submitted to the 
Controller of Examinations (P.G. Programmes) through the Guide and the Head of the 
Department on or before the last working day for the students of the College for the aca demic 
year. If a student fails to submit the project report on or before the last working day, he/she is 
eligible to get extension for submission of the Project as per the stipulations given below.

undertake the project work during the subsequent academic year taking a new topic. Students 
who availed the Extension provision will not be eligible for receiving the rank.  
 
6. The project report will be valued for 80 marks by two Examiners, of whom, one will be the 
Guide and the other will be an External Examiner. The project report will be valued for 40 marks 
by each Examiner. The sum of marks awarded by both the examiners wil l be considered to be the 
final marks. For a pass in the project report, the student should secure a minimum of 40 marks. If 
a student fails to secure 40 marks in the evaluation of project report, he / she may be permitted to 
resubmit his / her project rep ort once again after incorporating the necessary corrections, if any, 
as suggested by the Examiners within a period of three months from the date of publication of 
the results of the Examinations.   
 
7. A student who has secured 40 marks or above in the eva luation of project report would be 
permitted to appear for the viva voce . The viva voce  carries a maximum of 20 marks and will be 
conducted jointly by the External Examiner and the Guide. The student should secure a 
minimum of 10 marks in the viva voce. Th e student who fails to attend the viva voce  or fails to 
secure 10 marks in the viva voce  should reappear for the same after a month but within a period 
of three months from the date of publication of results. In any case, no student will be permitted 
to ap pear for the viva voce  more than twice. If a student fails during his / her second appearance 
also in viva voce , he / she has to choose a new topic for his / her project and resubmit the Project 
report within three months after the publication of the resul ts of the second viva voce  
Examination.
