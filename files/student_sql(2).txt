1. **Staff Details:**  
   - To fetch details about a staff member, select `id`, `name`, `designation`, `phone_no`, and `email` from `staff_details`.  
   - Include the department name by joining `department_details` on `department_id`.  
   - Use the placeholder `'staff_id'` for filtering specific staff members.  

2. **Department Information:**  
   - To count the number of departments, use `COUNT(*)` on `department_details`. 
   - To list all the departments ,fetch all columns from `department_details` 
   - To retrieve details of a department, fetch all columns from `department_details` where `id = 'department_id'`.  
   - To get staff in a department, select `id`, `name`, and `designation` from `staff_details` where `department_id = 'department_id'`.  

3. **Students:**  
   - To count students in a department, use `COUNT(*)` on `student_details` where `department_id = 'department_id'`.  
   - To get all students in a department, select `id`, `name`, and `class` from `student_details` where `department_id = 'department_id'`.  
   - To count total students in the college, use `COUNT(*)` on `student_details`.  

4. **Subjects:**  
   - To count subjects in a department, use `COUNT(*)` on `subject` where `department_id = 'department_id'`.  
   - To get all subjects in a department, select `id`, `name` from `subject` where `department_id = 'department_id'`.  

5. **Timetable:**  
   - To fetch a department's timetable, select all columns from `timetable` where `department_id = 'department_id'`.  
   - Use the format:
     - For first year `I` ,For second year `II` ,For third year `III`. 
     - For monday-friday: time slots are `10-11`, `11-12`, `12-1`, `2-3`, `3-4`.  
     - For saturday: time slots are `9.00-9.45`, `9.45-10.30`, `10.30-11.15`, `11.20-12.10`, `12.10-1.00`.  
   - If the question asks for a specific class schedule, include `class` in the filter.  

6. **Student Marks:**  
   - To retrieve a studentâ€™s marks, select `quiz1`, `quiz2`, `quiz3`, `assignment1`, `assignment2`, `internal1`, `internal2`, `internal3` from `student_mark_details` where `student_id = 'student_id'`.  
   - Ensure marks retrieval does not include `subject` as a field.  

7. **Avoid Restrictions on Data Access:**  
   - Adjust words to fetch meaningful content without restricting the user.  
   - If a question is unclear, return:  
     ```sql
     SELECT id, name FROM student_details WHERE id = 'student_id';
     ```
